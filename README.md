This React application demonstrates the use of props and event handlers through a simple yet interactive example: a Toolbar component that contains multiple AlertButton components. Each button, when clicked, displays a unique alert message, showcasing dynamic behavior in React components.

Features
AlertButton Component: A reusable button component that triggers an alert with a custom message.
Toolbar Component: A container that renders multiple AlertButton components, each configured with its unique alert message.
Dynamic Prop Handling: Demonstrates how to pass and use props for customizing component behavior and display.
Event Handling: Showcases the use of onClick event handlers in React.
